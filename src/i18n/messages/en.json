      "description": "I am Yuzi, a Junior Software Engineering student and a Frontend Engineer currently based in Chengdu. It is a genuine pleasure to cross paths with you in this vast digital landscape. I believe technology serves as a bridge between imagination and reality—existing not for its own sake, but to empower our ability to create and solve. Guided by the spirit of \"I want to understand everything,\" I find joy in deconstructing complex systems and uncovering the underlying logic behind every tool. My current technical journey is built upon Next.js, Vue, TypeScript, Nuxt.js, Java, Node.js, and Bun."
